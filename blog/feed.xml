            <description><![CDATA[0.3.0 is here! We've bumped the minor version because it's a breaking change (just a small one, see [HISTORY.md](https://github.com/reasonml/reason-react/blob/master/HISTORY.md#030).

_v0.2.4 was done in collaboration with the ReactJS team_.

This is a release we've been planning for quite a while now, and is one that embodies what the Reason team is trying to achieve through ReasonReact.
